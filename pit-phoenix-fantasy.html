										<h1>PITTSBURGH PHOENIX</h1>
										<ul class="categories">
											<li>Fantasy Hockey Identity</li>
										</ul>
<p>In the spring of 2021, I designed the Pittsburgh Phoenix brand as my senior project in university. It was designed as a fictional team that played in the NWHL in the 1980s. The page for that project with more details can be found at <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/129332195/Pittsburgh-Phoenix">this link</a>.</p>

<p>Myself and a group of friends participate in a fantasy hockey league called the JNHL - Jersey Nerds Hockey League. Each member is a designer, and while we may have differening levels of design experience and skill, we share a love for sports uniforms, and designing them ourselves. Thus, each member of the league designs their own team from the ground up, choosing a city for their team to play in, a team moniker, and of course creating the team's logos and uniforms. And I liked my Pittsburgh Phoenix brand so much, that I chose to "modernize" it for use in the JNHL.</p>
<p class="nbsp">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Color Scheme">COLOR SCHEME</h2>
<p>Being a sports team playing in Pittsburgh, the obvious choice is to stick with the iconic black and gold. And for the team's inaugural 2021-22 JNHL season,  the color palette was strictly such - black, gold, and white. But, entering the 2022-23 campaign, I felt the identity needed to be spiced up a bit this season. I chose to add three shades of orange to the black, gold, and white, giving a much more fiery palette to the team based on a flaming bird.</p>

</div>
<p>Only the darkest shade of orange is used in team logos, while the other two shades are only used in the uniforms (shown later).</p>
<p class="nbsp">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Primary Logo">PRIMARY LOGO</h2>
<div class="project-image">
    <img src="img/phoenix_fantasy/phx_primary.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>Originally the Phoenix’s secondary logo in their first JNHL season, the primary logo features the head of the Phoenix peeking out of a triangle. If you notice a resemblance to the Pittsburgh Penguins' "robo penguin" logo, you would be correct. Seeing as this is merely a fantasy hockey team, I chose to pay homage to the team that I grew up cheering for that plays in the same city. Even without the homage, the golden triangle is of course still relevant Pittsburgh symbolism.</p>
<p class="nbsp">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Secondary Logo">SECONDARY LOGO</h2>
<div class="project-image">
    <img src="img/phoenix_fantasy/phx_secondary.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>Originally the primary logo, this is simply a modernized version of the 1980s Phoenix logo from the original senior project.</p>
<p class="nbsp">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="Uniforms">JERSEYS</h2>

</div>
<p>As previously stated, I felt like the Phoenix needed a visual shakeup for their final season, so I also decided to go a bit out of the box with their uniforms. While it isn't anything too crazy, the three shades of orange create a faux gradient out of the stripes on the jersey, creating a fittingly fiery look for the team.</p>
